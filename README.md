# Algorand Inventory Management System

A blockchain-based inventory management system built on the Algorand blockchain. This system leverages Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) and smart contracts to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient inventory management solution.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Data Structure**: Each product is represented as an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) with unique properties
- **Smart Contract Functionality**: Automated inventory checks, reordering, and audit processes
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Hierarchical security with multi-signature requirements
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track inventory levels, transactions, and performance metrics
- **IPFS Integration**: Store product metadata and backups on IPFS
- **Audit Trail**: Complete on-chain record of all inventory changes

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **Inventory Contract**: Manages product data, quantities, and thresholds
2. **Asset Manager**: Handles ASA creation, modification, and transfers
3. **Oracle Contract**: Performs automated checks and connects with external systems
4. **Security Contract**: Manages access control and data backup

### Frontend

- React-based responsive web interface
- Integration with Algorand blockchain via JavaScript SDK
- Real-time data visualization with Chart.js
- Mobile-friendly design with Bootstrap

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Node.js 14+
- Algorand Sandbox or access to an Algorand node
- PyTeal
- Algorand JavaScript SDK

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorand-inventory-management.git
   cd algorand-inventory-management
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contracts:
   ```
   python3 scripts/deploy.py
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Smart Contract Deployment

The deployment script will:
1. Compile the PyTeal contracts to TEAL
2. Deploy all four contracts to the Algorand blockchain
3. Save the application IDs to a JSON file for frontend use

## Usage

### Creating a Product

1. Navigate to the Products page
2. Click "Add New Product"
3. Fill in the product details
4. Submit the form to create a new ASA representing the product

### Managing Inventory

1. View current inventory levels on the Dashboard
2. Update product quantities from the Product Detail page
3. Monitor low stock items and reorder when necessary

### Auditing

1. View the complete transaction history on the Transactions page
2. Filter transactions by type, date, or product
3. Export audit reports as needed

## Security Architecture

- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Manager, and Operator roles with different permissions
- **Multi-Signature Requirements**: Critical operations require multiple approvals
- **Immutable Transaction Records**: All inventory changes are permanently recorded on the blockchain
- **Automated Backups**: Regular backups to IPFS with blockchain references

## API Integration

The system provides REST APIs for integration with:
- Point of Sale (POS) systems
- Accounting software
- Supplier management systems
- Shipping and logistics platforms
